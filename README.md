# Skylines-ControlBuildingLevelUpMod
ControlBuildingLevelUpMod is a gameplay modification for the game Cities: Skylines. (see http://www.citiesskylines.com/)
It enables you to control your city development by preventing buildings from upgrading to a certain level. Simple select a (growable) building of your choice and click on one of the level-up progressbars and the building won't exceed over this selected lock-level. If you select a lower level than the actual level of the building it will be bulldozed.
